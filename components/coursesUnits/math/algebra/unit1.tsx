            In algebra, variables and constants play distinct roles in forming algebraic expressions and equations. Understanding the difference between them is fundamental to solving problems and manipulating mathematical expressions effectively.

            <strong>Variables:</strong><br/>
            Variables are symbols or letters used to represent unknown or changing values in algebraic expressions and equations. Commonly used variables include letters like &quot;x,&quot; &quot;y,&quot; &quot;a,&quot; &quot;b,&quot; and so on. Variables represent quantities that can vary or change. They often stand for values that we want to find or solve for in equations. Variables allow us to create equations that express relationships between different quantities. For example, &quot;2x&quot; represents twice the value of x, where x is the variable. In equations, variables are the values we aim to isolate or solve for by performing various mathematical operations.

            <strong>Constants:</strong><br/>
            Constants are fixed values that do not change within a given context or problem. They are often represented by specific numbers, such as 2, 3.14 (Ï€), or -5. Constants are used in algebraic expressions to provide known values or coefficients. For instance, in the expression &quot;3x,&quot; the constant &quot;3&quot; multiplies the variable &quot;x.&quot; Constants remain the same throughout an equation or expression and are used to scale or modify the impact of variables. In real-world applications, constants can represent known quantities, such as conversion factors, interest rates, or physical constants like the speed of light.

            <strong>Why Identifying Variables and Constants Matters:</strong><br/>
            Formulating Equations: Variables and constants are essential for creating equations that model real-world problems. Variables represent the quantities that can change, while constants provide known values or coefficients. Problem Solving: In problem-solving, identifying variables helps us define what we are trying to find or solve for. Constants provide the known values needed to set up equations. Algebraic Manipulation: When simplifying algebraic expressions or solving equations, its crucial to distinguish between variables and constants. This distinction guides the application of mathematical operations. Interpretation: In mathematical modeling, variables and constants enable us to interpret the meaning of equations. Variables can represent physical quantities like distance, time, or cost, while constants can represent fixed parameters.
